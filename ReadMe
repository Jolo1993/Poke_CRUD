Key Files to Implement

    app.py - Main entry point for your Flask application
    app/__init__.py - Flask application factory
    app/api/routes.py - Define your CRUD endpoints
    app/services/quickwit_service.py - Quickwit integration logic
    data_pipeline/fetcher.py - PokéAPI data fetching
    docker/Dockerfile - Container configuration
    kubernetes/app-deployment.yaml - Kubernetes deployment

Development Flow

    Start by implementing the data pipeline to fetch Pokémon data
    Set up Quickwit integration services
    Develop Flask CRUD API endpoints
    Containerize the application
    Create Kubernetes deployment files
    Set up scripts for easy deployment

This structure provides a clean separation of concerns and follows best practices for a Flask
application with a data pipeline component.
